# Equities-and-other-assets-vs-the-S-P-500
The goal of this project is to import data from an online source and process the data using various python libraries. Then I will choose five distinct equities or assets in different classes. A regression analysis is done on each of the asset against the S&P 500 to determine if there is any correlation.
